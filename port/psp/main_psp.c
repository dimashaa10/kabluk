 * Same shape as main_sdl.c: build quakeparms_t, hand the memory block to the
 * engine, then call Host_Frame forever.  What changes is the memory budget
 * (a PSP has 32 or 64 MB of RAM, not 384) and the fact that we own main():
 * port/psp/Makefile defines SDL_MAIN_HANDLED, so SDL no longer renames it and
 * we have to tell SDL that initialisation is our business (SDL_SetMainReady).
 *
 * Data files are expected next to the EBOOT, i.e. in the game directory on the
 * memory stick; the loader runs the module with that directory as cwd.
